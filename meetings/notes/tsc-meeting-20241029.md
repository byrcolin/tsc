## Meeting Notes

### Announcement - Joe
* Point Release is being scheduled - recommended: Wednesday nov 6th.
* Meeting is 9:30 PST
* Release won't take as much effort as a full release.
   * Perf issue
   * Install script only mode
   * Maybe spaces in user name issue
   * Installer issues fixed
* Connect meeting is on the 13th.  Creating an email about ROSCON.
* Was extremely successful for us, tons of interest and buzz
* We were sharing a booth with Robotec and that worked out really well.  Robotec uses Open3dE for many customers and use cases
* There was a lot of interest.  I'll be working on a roadmap, some of it informed by what we learned from ROSCon, and what we learned on the game side.  Roadmap expected by EOD friday this week. (1st).  Will send to sig-all for review.
* Steve P and Roddie helped staff the booth and it was so busy that even with 3 of them they could not keep up.
* A few talks that other companies had, where O3DE was talked about without any prompting or anything
* The #1 thing to talk about was moving from Gazebo to O3DE and what that would look like.

### Discussion - The release
* Which repos are we doing?
* o3de (nick)
* o3de-extras (Jan Hanca)

### Discussion - Naomi Washington [LF]
* Naomi: Please help me merge the PRs to the right place.
* Shauna:  Already moved over

### Discussion - Naomi Washington [LF]
* A lot of things called out between branding guidlines vs the documentation website.
* With the website revamp we pulled it over into the main website, if we want to pull it back, let me know
* There is a member working on a 3d model of O3DE mascot.  

### Discussion - Sid_Moudgil [Amzn]
* I'll get a PR for the perf being 24x worse for iOS.  Shadow ISsue, VMEM leak issue, etc.
