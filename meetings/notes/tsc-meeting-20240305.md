### Agenda Item - Steve P - Sig-Simulation
* Who owns the animation system.  Is Sig-Simulation the owner?
* Joe:  Sig content - but its listed a challenge in 2024.  
    * nobody "owns" animation and nobody maintains it.  
    * Many of the systems that it relies on are changing, even though nobody is modifying the animation system itsel
    * So instability is developing.

### Agenda Item:  When is the next point release?
* Joe:  On todo list - we need to still schedule this and the difficulty is getting an overall stability pass.
* ColinB: we need a public testing plan of some sort maybe?  Some way to map the whole engine out but then have people cover various areas without overlap
* Joe:  If we have 2 people duplicate on the same feature, I'm okay on that, so we have people on those area.
