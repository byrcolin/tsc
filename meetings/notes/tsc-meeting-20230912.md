This is a regular TSC meeting.  No agenda items were added.

Discussion of "script only mode"
 - PR is ready in draft mode
 - No launcher support yet, but still worth committing

 - Next steps:  getting a prebuilt launcher executable, getting the existing draft pr committed.

Discussion of APMGs Asset Store
 - going well, but not ready yet.
