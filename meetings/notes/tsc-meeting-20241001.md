## Open Discussion

### Discussion - colinb[APMG]
* Concerned about what's going on with the godot engine.
* Its blowing up kind of badly right now, it has all to do with moderation and their response to the community has been poor I believe.
* I just don't want us to fall into the same problem.
* Joe:  Different beast of the same species thats happening to Godot
* Joe:  Bascally, the godot issue is that every year Godot has celebrated different things, pride month, etc.  This year, their
  community manager worded it very differently, and the CM wasn't bought into what they were doing, and was supposed to be "hey its pride month,
  please post projects that are created with Godot that are or can be associated with pride month."
* Joe:  Instead they posted "Hey Godot is woke now, please post your woke projects."
* Joe:  There was a big uproar in the community, etc.  It caught the community managers by surprise and they started banning everyone
  about it, etc.  
* Joe:  I'll send it to you, (colinb) but we have a code of conduct and standards for CM.  Right now I'm very picky about who I choose for CM duty, 
  and talked about this issue going forward.
* Joe:  As far as CM actions go, we are going to ban/silence people, but we have right now a lot of large companies looking at O3DE for projects, investments, etc,
        our community needs to be coherent and not a mess.  And plus, for the users coming in, I don't them to be bombarded by negativity.
        We have a doc that says how you escalate, these are the cases we will escalate against, etc. 
        We don't just ban you, there are specific rules around things we can and cannot action.
        I understand your concern around that, but we do CM training, and we are really picky about who we pick for CM, I just don't see
        that happening.
        We will give people warnings, silence them, if they are coming in and offering nothing constructive, just destructive.
        In every case, we figure out whether they have value to the community, and in every case so far its been nothing lost from the community.
        Constructive feedback is great.  The valueless statements are like "don't use O3DE use cry instead."  They come in and wreak havoc in the channels.
        I had a conversation, we talked to that person.
        If they instead come in and say something like "I can't use O3DE because we don't have a particle editor" or "its missing this and that feature for us"
        then that is useful and we can work on / prioritize.  
        But I'm not going to sit around and let someone wreak havoc by pointing new users who know nothing about the engine, from this to something else.
        So (colinb) your concern is valid, but we do have CM requirements and training and how they message things and so on.
* colinb: I don't really have a question about it, I think we obviously need moderation, and it should not be in the hands of any one person.
          We should talk about the concequences to our community
* matthew_fr: As a developer who has followed o3de for a while.  One of the reasons that O3DE won't ahve the same situations
              godot had no official discord, then it became the official unofficial, then there were problems with moderations.
              so they made a new one.  The problem is the manager from the unofficial one, they were colorful, that was fanning the fires.
* JT: I was working with blender folks, and when godot interfaces with blender, I've watched godot ever since.
      There was some long time that have similar built up similar to other open source projects.
      When there are 2 different discords, like a community unofficial one plus an officila one, etc.
      Things like "why wont you fix this after x years" general resentment that builds up in long term open source projects.
      Some of this stuff triggers.  We don't have the same triggers in this community.  
      Null mentioned it last time, colin this time, it can come up, it doesn't have the same background, energy, etc.
* Joe: one of the things I explained to the board (personal opinion), but godot leadership has never been one for tact.
       This isn't the first time something like that has happened.  They need to be careful about what they say is public that is official.
       Even if your intentions are good, be careful about how you word things.  Its very easy for something to be taken out of context no matter
       how good it is, it becomes its own viral entity, essentially.
       We pass most public communication thru marketing to prevent that.
       But I have years upon years of experience of community management (it was one of my primary jobs at AMZN).
       The risk of what happens is very low for O3DE but its still there.
       I will do what I can, we had a couple conversations yesterday, I sent the information to our marketing team as well, so that they are aware,
       I won't say it wouldn't happen to us, but the chances are low since we have a bunch of people who know what they are doing, and hte LF has 
       been around for a long time and has had to deal with this many times before, and knows how to say these things so that they don't trigger a giant
       reaction from the community.
* JT:  This is something that takes several rounds.  Hopefully we can nip things in the bud with our team we have.
* Joe: This is also a good situation for us, if we're seen as not heading down those same paths that godot is, we have people who look at us.
       Like when Unity made changes to licensing.  We should be prepared to take people in and be ready when people ask.
* colinb: I just want everyone to learn from these mistakes and not repeat them.
* Joe:  I do agree with the statement - first and foremost we are an engine forum. We are about engine, game dev, simulation engines, that happen to be
        o3de.  we are not a closed source platform, we don't talk about politics or religion, we don't talk about those subjects, we talk about game engines.
        We have a pretty strong rule around shutting down those conversions quickly, this one is about game engines, simulation engines, and abuot growing o3de,
        and answering questions about o3de and thats it.
* Nick: Do we have a response plan for if something blows up?
* Joe:  If something truly negative happens.
* Matthew French:  you want 2 atomic keys
* Joe:  We have a forum for moderators only, and if we something that is troubling, usually what happens is they will message Joe after discussing and ask them if they're ok to take actions.  I'm trying to teach them to take action.  No single moderator including myself is allowed to unilaterally take actions against someone.
* Matthew French: They banned people from the github source and they couldn't get latest.
* Joe: that's not something we will do.
* colinb: They banned people for talking about politics.

### Discussion: JT - Patent news
* JT:   I don't want to over-explain but the acceleration/bay AWS lawsuit and spread quite a bit.
* JT:   Technically AWS was found in violation.
* Joe:  We may be clear - we entirely removed gridmate from O3DE, and may have to warn users if anyone is still using it, but gridmate is not part of O3De anymore.

* Joe:  Send this kind of thing to me, so I think just let me know.  When people let me know, I forward to the LF/Naomi, etc.
        They will give me their take on it.  Stuff like this is very common in open source.
* Joe:  this is also why we are trying to separate out the 3rd party gems into repos owned by AWS.
* Joe:  Patent trolls cannot sue for source code.  its sued for binaries, there is a separate company that owns the companies that we generate.
        Those sites are under a different company that has zero assets.  Those NPEs have learned that its pointless to go after those companies.
        LF does not own the binaries for O3DE at all.  I can get the full companies that own it, its like "the binaries for o3de" and it has 0 assets.
* JT:   Thanks for the situation awareness for giving it a little bit of time and having it trickle down for the communit.
* Joe:  Its why I ask community to review docs, make sure their needs are prioritized.  Without the community nothing happens for an open source project.
        The community and our contribs are what makes the project.

### Discussion: JT - Grants
* JT:   October is grant month!  There is a season to it, a timing to it, october is when you see about grant movements, etc.
* JT:   If you hear anything pay attention, if someone is talking about it, January is the beginning of the 2025 season
* (question: Are any international?)
* JT:   They are all over the place, there are france grants, germany grants, and other countries are now prividing grands to tech and tech
        development, open source, etc.  Its a thing thats growing, just a heads up, if someone is talking grants, then for example, french and germans
        are looking at film development.  So there's grant opportunities that are available, just be aware.  If they are on an annual cycle, 
        2025 grant season is starting now for January grants, they are usually large grants (for a full year of funding.)

### Discussion: Matthew French
* I am 100% more confident about the future of O3DE after this discussion.
