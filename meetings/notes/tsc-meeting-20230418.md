Royal: Silicon studio has joined the foundation!

Nick: Are the board meetings public?
Royal: The board meeting and minutes are private.  But the results/decisions are public filtered down thru the TSC/TAC.
Royal: Possible new foundation project involving HDR.  To identify the device and capabilities.  There are HDR games which don't properly detect what the device can do and so when they run they look completely off.

Nick: (recommending the installer workflow)
Royal: I work in the installer constantly.
Royal: Canonical looking at snap packages, having an automated model that puts the output of the game on the snap package.  How to put the server side and deploy a snap, cloud deployment.
Nick:  (Reminding that the existing project build and deploy scripts are new and available and can work with this).

Royal: Other news, WebGPU Renderer interested in contributing

(Royal gives a quick tutorial for the Craig Bot - type /join in the voice chat channel and the bot will record)
Royal: If anyone needs bot access, send me a DM.
